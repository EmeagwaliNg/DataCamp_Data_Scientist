You will change the patch, minor or major version number, depending on how much you have changed in the package.\n\nThis time you have implemented a bug fix, changed the code style, changed the supported Python versions and written tests. If it weren't for the change to the supported Python version, this would probably only be a patch, as the only thing a user would notice is the bug fix. But because of this more serious change, it will instead be a minor version update.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- In the terminal, use bumpversion once to increase the minor version number by one.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"df482b34-6cf5-4bcf-bbd8-86443573a58f"},{"source":"```python\nbumpversion minor\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8451b237-6f31-49c8-90f3-8b7d22cc235e"},{"source":"## 4 Makefiles and classifiers\n\n## Classifiers\n- Metadata for your package\n- Helps users find your package on PyPI\n- You should include\n    - Package status\n    - Your intended audience\n    - License type\n    - Language\n    - Versions of Python supported\n- Lots more classifiers \n(https://pypi.org/classifiers)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"80704592-107c-40c5-8665-67a820c645a2"},{"source":"Inside `setup.py` of mysklearn\n\n```python\nsetup(    \n    ...    \n    classifiers=[\n        'Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha',\n        'Intended Audience :: Developers',\n        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',\n        'Natural Language :: English',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7',\n        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8', \n    ],   \n    ...\n)\n```\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"94ba85f5-46c4-4aa3-8e6c-cf8afaeca34b"},{"source":"## What are Makefiles for?\n- Used to automate parts of building your package\n\n## What is in a Makefile?\n\nInside `Makefile`\n\n```python\n...\n\ndist: ## builds source and wheel package    \n    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n    \nclean-build: ## remove build artifacts    \n        rm -fr build/    \n        rm -fr dist/    \n        rm -fr .eggs/\n        \ntest: ## run tests quickly with the default Python    \n    pytest\n    \nrelease: dist ## package and upload a release    \ntwine upload dist/*\n\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a8a044ae-4f26-409a-b15f-7198d9eb8e43"},{"source":"## How do I use the Makefile?\n\n```python\nmake <function-name>\n```\n\nTo use the dist function type this in terminal\n\n```python\nmake dist\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"32c00404-05a9-452f-9b92-632946fa41b7"},{"source":"## Makefile summary\n\n```python\nmake help\n```\n|                     |                                                     |\n|--------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|\n|clean                |remove all build, test, coverage and Python artifacts|\n|clean-build          |remove build artifacts|\n|clean-pyc            |remove Python file artifacts|\n|clean-test           |remove test and coverage artifacts\n|lint                 |check style with flake8|\n|test                 |run tests quickly with the default Python|\n|test-all             |run tests on every Python version with tox|\n|release              |package and upload a release|\n|dist                 |builds source and wheel package|\n|install              |install the package to the active Python's site-packages|\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"79e2a6bf-e878-4c1f-8814-0340daf6a479"},{"source":"## PyPI classifiers\nClassifiers help your users discover your code on PyPI, and it is best practice to include them.
