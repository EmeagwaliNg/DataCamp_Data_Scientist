Let's see how.  \n\n```python\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train.csv')\ntrain_y = train['labels'].values \ntrain_X = train[col for col in train.columns if col != 'labels'].values  \ntrain_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(train_X) \nplt.scatter(train_pca[:,0], train_pca[:,1])\nval = pd.read_csv('validation.csv')\nval_y = val['labels'].values\nval_X = val[col for col in val.columns if col != 'labels'].values\nval_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(val_X)\nplt.scatter(val_pca[:,0], val_pca[:,1])\ntest = pd.read_csv('test.csv')\ntest_y = test['labels'].values  \ntest_X = test[col for col in test.columns if col != 'labels'].values \ntest_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(train_X)\nplt.scatter(test_pca[:,0], test_pca[:,1])\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, I loaded my train, validation, and test data, and plot the first two principal components of each dataset. I wrote the code for the train dataset, then copied it and pasted it into the next two blocks, updating the paths and the variable names.\n\n### The problem with repeating yourself\n\nBut one of the problems with copying and pasting is that it is easy to accidentally introduce errors that are hard to spot. If you'll notice in the last block, I accidentally took the principal components of the train data instead of the test data. Yikes!\n\n```python\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train.csv') \ntrain_y = train['labels'].values  \ntrain_X = train[col for col in train.columns if col != 'labels'].values \ntrain_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(train_X) \nplt.scatter(train_pca[:,0], train_pca[:,1]) \nval = pd.read_csv('validation.csv') \nval_y = val['labels'].values  \nval_X = val[col for col in val.columns if col != 'labels'].values  \nval_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(val_X)  \nplt.scatter(val_pca[:,0], val_pca[:,1]) \ntest = pd.read_csv('test.csv')  \ntest_y = test['labels'].values \ntest_X = test[col for col in test.columns if col != 'labels'].values  \ntest_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(train_X) ### yikes! ###  \nplt.scatter(test_pca[:,0], test_pca[:,1])\n```\n\n### Another problem with repeating yourself\n\nAnother problem with repeated code is that if you want to change something, you often have to do it in multiple places. For instance, if we realized that our CSVs used the column name \"label\" instead of \"labels\", we would have to change our code in six places. Repeated code like this is a good sign that you should write a function. So let's do that.\n\n```python\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train.csv') \ntrain_y = train['labels'].values ### <- there and there --v ### \ntrain_X = train[col for col in train.columns if col != 'labels'].values  \ntrain_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(train_X)  \nplt.scatter(train_pca[:,0], train_pca[:,1])  \nval = pd.read_csv('validation.csv')  \nval_y = val['labels'].values ### <- there and there --v ### \nval_X = val[col for col in val.columns if col != 'labels'].values  \nval_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(val_X)  \nplt.scatter(val_pca[:,0], val_pca[:,1])  \ntest = pd.read_csv('test.csv')  \ntest_y = test['labels'].values ### <- there and there --v ###  \ntest_X = test[col for col in test.columns if col != 'labels'].values \ntest_pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(test_X)  \nplt.scatter(test_pca[:,0], test_pca[:,1])\n```\n\n### Use functions to avoid repetition\n\nWrapping the repeated logic in a function and then calling that function several times makes it much easier to avoid the kind of errors introduced by copying and pasting. And if you ever need to change the column \"label\" back to \"labels\", or you want to swap out PCA for some other dimensionality reduction technique, you only have to do it in one or two places.\n\n```python\ndef load_and_plot(path):  \n    \"\"\"Load a data set and plot the first two principal components.  \n    Args:  \n    path (str): The location of a CSV file.  \n    Returns:  \n    tuple of ndarray: (features, labels)  \n    \"\"\"  \n    data = pd.read_csv(path)  \n    y = data['label'].values  \n    X = data[col for col in train.columns if col != 'label'].values  \n    pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(X)  \n    plt.scatter(pca[:,0], pca[:,1])  \n    return X, y  \n ```\n\n```python\ntrain_X, train_y = load_and_plot('train.csv') \nval_X, val_y = load_and_plot('validation.csv')  \ntest_X, test_y = load_and_plot('test.csv')\n```\n\n\n\n\n##  Problem: it does multiple things\n\nHowever, there is still a big problem with this function.\n- First, it loads the data.\n- Then it plots the data.\n- And then it returns the loaded data. \n\nThis function violates another software engineering principle: **Do One Thing**. Every function should have a single responsibility. Let's look at how we could split this one up.\nInstead of one big function, we could have a more nimble function that just loads the data and a second one for plotting. We get several advantages from splitting the `load_and_plot()` function into two smaller functions. \n\n```python\ndef load_and_plot(path):  \n    \"\"\"Load a data.  \n    Args:  \n    path (str): The location of a CSV file.  \n    Returns:  \n    tuple of ndarray: (features, labels)  \n    \"\"\"  \n    data = pd.read_csv(path)  \n    y = data['label'].values  \n    X = data[col for col in train.columns if col != 'label'].values  \n    return X, y  \n```   \n\n```python\ndef load_and_plot(path):  \n    \"\"\"Plot the first two principal components of a matrix.  \n    Args:  \n    X (numpy.ndarray): The data to plot.  \n    \"\"\"  \n    pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(X)  \n    plt.scatter(pca[:,0], pca[:,1])      \n```\n\n### Advantages of doing one thing\n\n- Flexible: First of all, our code has become more flexible. Imagine that later on in your script, you just want to load the data and not plot it. That's easy now with the `load_data()` function. Likewise, if you wanted to do some transformation to the data before plotting, you can do the transformation and then call the plot_data() function. We have decoupled the loading functionality from the plotting functionality.\n\n- Easier to understand: The code will also be easier for other developers to understand, \n- Easier to debug and test: it will be more pleasant to test and debug. \n- Easier to predict changes: Finally, if you ever need to update your code, functions that each have a single responsibility make it easier to predict how changes in one place will affect the rest of the code.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54c64638-a927-4b3a-993a-72897d4882d1"},{"source":"## Extract a function\nWhile you were developing a model to predict the likelihood of a student graduating from college, you wrote this bit of code to get the z-scores of students' yearly GPAs.

Before the party starts, the caterers set up tables with food and drinks. Then you and your friends dance, eat, and have a good time. When the party is done, the caterers clean up the food and remove the tables.\n \n### Catered party as context\n\nIn this analogy, the caterers are like a context manager;\n\n- First, they set up a context for your party, which was a room full of food and drinks. \n- Then they let you and your friends do whatever you want. This is like you being able to run your code inside the context manager's context. -\n- Finally, when the party is over, the caterers clean up and remove the context that the party happened in.\n|context manager      |caterers|\n|-----------         |---------|\n|Sets up a context    |Set up the tables with food and drink|\n|Runs your code       |Let you and your friends have a party|\n|Remove the context    |Cleaned up and removed the tables|\n\n## A real-world example\n`with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:`  \n`text = my_file.read()`  \n`length = len(text)`  \n`print('The file is {} characters long'.format(length))` \n\n**`open()` function as a context manager does three things:**  \n- Sets up a context by opening a file\n- Lets you run any code you want on that file\n- Removes the context by closing the file\n\n## Using a context manager\nAny time you use a context manager, it will look like this. \n`with`  \nThe keyword `\"with\"` lets Python know that you are trying to enter a context.  \nThen you call a function. You can call any function that is built to work as a context manager. In the next lesson, I'll show you how to write your own functions that work this way. \n\n## Compound Statement\n\nStatements in Python that have an indented block after them, like for loops, if/else statements, function definitions, etc. are called \"compound statements\". The `\"with\"` statement is another type of compound statement. Any code that you want to run inside the context that the context manager created needs to be indented. When the indented block is done, the context manager gets a chance to clean up anything that it needs to, like when the `\"open()\"` context manager closed the file.\n\n`with <context-manager>(<args>):`  \n`# Run your code here`  \n`# This code is running \"inside the context\"`  \n\n`# This code runs after the context is removed`  \n\n`with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:`  \n`text = my_file.read()`  \n`length = len(text)`   \n`print('The file is {} characters long'.format(length))`    \nSome context managers want to return a value that you can use inside the context. By adding `\"as\" `and a variable name at the end of the `\"with\"` statement, you can assign the returned value to the variable name. We used this ability when calling the `\"open()\"` context manager, which returns a file that we can read from or write to.

One way you could write this function would be to open the source file, store the contents of the file in the \"contents\" variable, then open the destination file and write the contents to it. This approach works fine until you try to copy a file that is too large to fit in memory.  \n`with open('my_file.txt') as my_file:`  \n`for line in my_file:`  \n`# do something`  \n\nWhat would be ideal is if we could open both files at once and copy over one line at a time.

Imagine you've written this function that lets someone connect to the printer.  \n\n`def get_printer(ip):`  \n`p = connect_to_printer(ip)`  \n`yield`  \n`# This MUST be called or no one else will`  \n`# be able to connect to the printer`  \n`p.disconnect()`  \n`print('disconnected from printer')`  \n`doc = {'text': 'This is my text.'}`  \n`with get_printer('10.0.34.111') as printer:`  \n`printer.print_page(doc['txt'])`  \n\nThe printer only allows one connection at a time, so it is imperative that \"p.disconnect()\" gets called, or else no one else will be able to print! Someone decides to use your get_printer() function to print the text of their document. However, they weren't paying attention and accidentally typed \"txt\" instead of \"text\". This will raise a KeyError because \"txt\" is not in the \"doc\" dictionary. And that means \"p.disconnect()\" doesn't get called.\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):  \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>  \nprinter.print_page(doc['txt'])  \nKeyError: 'txt'  \n    \n\n So what can we do? You may be familiar with the \"try\" statement. It allows you to write code that might raise an error inside the `\"try\"` block and catch that error inside the `\"except\"` block. You can choose to ignore the error or re-raise it. The `\"try\"` statement also allows you to add a `\"finally\"` block. This is code that runs no matter what, whether an exception occurred or not.  \n    \n`try:`  \n`# code that might raise an error`  \n`except:`  \n`# do something about the error`  \n`finally:`  \n`# this code runs no matter what` \n    \nThe solution then is to put a `\"try\"` statement before the `\"yield\"` statement in our `get_printer()` function and a `\"finally\"` statement before `\"p.disconnect()\"`. When the sloppy programmer runs their code, they still get the KeyError, but `\"finally\"` ensures that `\"p.disconnect()\"` is called before the error is raised.   \n    \n`def get_printer(ip):`     \n`p = connect_to_printer(ip)`  \n`try:`  \n`yield`  \n`finally:`  \n`p.disconnect()`  \n`print('disconnected from printer')`  \n`doc = {'text': 'This is my text.'}`  \n`with get_printer('10.0.34.111') as printer:`  \n`printer.print_page(doc['txt'])`      \n    \n## Context manager patterns\n\n| | |\n|-- |--|\n|Open |Close|\n|Lock |Release|\n|Change |Reset|\n|Enter |Exit|\n|Start |Stop|\n|Setup |Teardown|\n|Connect |Disconnect|\n    \n    \nIf you notice that your code is following any of these patterns, you might consider using a context manager.

You'll want to be sure that any errors that occur during model training don't prevent you from resetting the working directory to its original location.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Add a statement that lets you handle any errors that might occur inside the context.\n- Add a statement that ensures os.chdir(current_dir) will be called, whether there was an error or not.\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"295c174e-3847-4bef-9383-bc3bb2375dd1"},{"source":"def in_dir(directory):\n  \"\"\"Change current working directory to `directory`,\n  allow the user to run some code, and change back.\n\n  Args:\n    directory (str): The path to a directory to work in.\n  \"\"\"\n  current_dir = os.getcwd()\n  os.chdir(directory)\n\n  # Add code that lets you handle errors\n  try:\n    yield\n  # Ensure the directory is reset,\n  # whether there was an error or not\n  finally:\n    os.chdir(current_dir)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"17abaeff-5a6a-447d-9324-50e11e9e1d2a","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Excellent error handling!

When we say `\"print(x)\"` here, Python knows we mean the x that we just defined. What happens if we redefine x inside the function foo() though? In foo()'s print() statement, do we mean the x that equals 42 or the x that equals 7? Python applies the same logic we applied with Tom and Janelle and assumes we mean the x that was defined right there in the function. However, there is no y defined in the function foo(), so it looks outside the function for a definition when asked to print y. Note that setting x equal to 42 inside the function foo() doesn't change the value of x that we set earlier outside of the function.\n\n`def foo():`  \n`x = 42`  \n`print(x)`  \n`print(y)`  \n`foo()`  \n- Output: 42\n200  \n`print(x)`  \n- Output: 7  \n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 2.54.25 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-08-11%20at%202.54.25%20PM.png)\n\nPython has to have strict rules about which variable you are referring to when using a particular variable name. So when we typed print(x) in the function foo(), the interpreter had to follow those rules to determine which x we meant.\n\nFirst, the interpreter looks in the local scope. When you are inside a function, the local scope is made up of the arguments and any variables defined inside the function.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 2.51.03 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-08-11%20at%202.51.03%20PM.png) \n\nIf the interpreter can't find the variable in the local scope, it expands its search to the global scope. These are the things defined outside the function.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 2.53.28 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-08-11%20at%202.53.28%20PM.png)\n\nFinally, if it can't find the thing it is looking for in the global scope, the interpreter checks the builtin scope. These are things that are always available in Python. For instance, the print() function is in the builtin scope, which is why we are able to use it in our foo() function.  \n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 2.56.39 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-08-11%20at%202.56.39%20PM.png)\n\nI actually skipped a level in that diagram. In the case of nested functions, where one function is defined inside another function, Python will check the scope of the parent function before checking the global scope. This is called the nonlocal scope to show that it is not the local scope of the child function and not the global scope.\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-08-11 at 2.56.54 PM](Screen%20Shot%202023-08-11%20at%202.56.54%20PM.png)  \n\n## The global keyword\n\nNote that Python only gives you read access to variables defined outside of your current scope. In foo() when we set x equal to 42, Python assumed we wanted a new variable in the local scope, not the x in the global scope. If what we had really wanted was to change the value of x in the global scope, then we have to declare that we mean the global x by using the global keyword. Notice that when we print x after calling foo() now, it prints 42 instead of 7 like it used to. However, you should try to avoid using global variables like this if possible, because it can make testing and debugging harder.  \n\n\n## The non-local keyword\nAnd if we ever want to modify a variable that is defined in the nonlocal scope, we have to use the \"nonlocal\" keyword. It works exactly the same as the \"global\" keyword, but it is used when you are inside a nested function, and you want to update a variable that is defined inside your parent function.  \n\n`x = 7`   \n`def foo():`    \n`x = 42`    \n`print(x)`    \n`foo()`    \n- Output: 42\n`print(x)`  \n- Output: 7\n`x = 7`  \n`def foo():`  \n`global x`  \n`x = 42`  \n`print(x)`  \n`foo()`  \n- Output: 42\n`print(x)`  \n- Output: 42","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0a75715d-3c91-4d09-9d4a-f361da48e4f7"},{"source":"# Understanding scope\nWhat four values does this script print?\n\nx = 50\n\ndef one():\n  x = 10\n\ndef two():\n  global x\n  x = 30\n\ndef three():\n  x = 100\n  print(x)\n\nfor func in [one, two, three]:\n  func()\n  print(x)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3cc4be3f-9335-4eb9-9b5c-c64a7f70b7ca"},{"source":"x = 50\n\ndef one():\n  x = 10\n\ndef two():\n  global x\n  x = 30\n\ndef three():\n  x = 100\n  print(x)\n\nfor func in [one, two, three]:\n  func()\n  print(x)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":97,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"473250bb-556a-4e8c-8012-901ff8204d9c","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"50\n30\n100\n30\n"}]},{"source":"- Good job! `one()` doesn't change the global x, so the first `print()` statement prints 50.\n\n- `two()` does change the global x so the second `print()` statement prints 30.\n\n- The `print()` statement inside the function `three()` is referencing the x value that is local to `three()`, so it prints 100.\n\n- But `three()` does not change the global x value so the last `print()` statement prints 30 again.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"543e96dd-b3fc-41ea-8e67-40143e73ce0f"},{"source":"# Modifying variables outside local scope\n\nSometimes your functions will need to modify a variable that is outside of the local scope of that function.

This lesson will walk you through some real-world decorators so that you can start to recognize common decorator patterns.\n\n## Time a function\n\nThe `timer()` decorator runs the decorated function and then prints how long it took for the function to run. I usually wind up adding some version of this to all of my projects because it is a pretty easy way to figure out where your computational bottlenecks are. All decorators have fairly similar-looking docstrings because they all take and return a single function. For brevity, I will only include the description of the function in the docstrings of the examples that follow.\n\n`import time`  \n`def timer(func):`  \n`\"\"\"A decorator that prints how long a function took to run.`  \n`Args:`  \n`func (callable): The function being decorated.`  \n`Returns:`  \n`callable: The decorated function.`  \n`\"\"\"`  \n\nLike most decorators, we'll start off by defining a wrapper() function. This is the function that the decorator will return. wrapper() takes any number of positional and keyword arguments so that it can be used to decorate any function. The first thing the new function will do is record the time that it was called with the time() function. Then wrapper() gets the result of calling the decorated function. We don't return that value yet though. After calling the decorated function, wrapper() checks the time again, and prints a message about how long it took to run the decorated function. Once we've done that, we need to return the value that the decorated function calculated.\n\n`import time`  \n`def timer(func):`  \n`\"\"\"A decorator that prints how long a function took to run.\"\"\"`  \n`# Define the wrapper function to return.`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`# When wrapper() is called, get the current time.`  \n`t_start = time.time()`  \n`# Call the decorated function and store the result.`  \n`result = func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`# Get the total time it took to run, and print it.`  \n`t_total = time.time() - t_start`  \n`print('{} took {}s'.format(func.__name__, t_total))`  \n`return result`  \n`return wrapper`  \n\n## Using timer()\n`@timer`  \n`def sleep_n_seconds(n):`  \n`time.sleep(n)`  \n`sleep_n_seconds(5)`  \n`sleep_n_seconds took 5.0050950050354s`  \n`sleep_n_seconds(10)`  \n- Output: sleep_n_seconds took 10.010067701339722s\n\nSo if we decorate this simple sleep_n_seconds() function, you can see that sleeping for 5 seconds takes about 5 seconds, and sleeping for 10 seconds takes about 10 seconds. This is a trivial use of the decorator to show it working, but it can be very useful for finding the slow parts of your code.\n\n\n# Memoizing\n\nMemoizing is the process of storing the results of a function so that the next time the function is called with the same arguments; you can just look up the answer. We start by setting up a dictionary that will map arguments to results. Then, as usual, we create `wrapper()` to be the new decorated function that this decorator returns. When the new function gets called, we check to see whether we've ever seen these arguments before. If we haven't, we send them to the decorated function and store the result in the \"cache\" dictionary. Now we can look up the return value quickly in a dictionary of results. The next time we call this function with those same arguments, the return value will already be in the dictionary.\n\n`def memoize(func):`  \n`\"\"\"Store the results of the decorated function for fast lookup`  \n`\"\"\"`  \n`# Store results in a dict that maps arguments to results`  \n`cache = {}`  \n`# Define the wrapper function to return.`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`# If these arguments haven't been seen before,`  \n`if (args, kwargs) not in cache:`  \n`# Call func() and store the result.`  \n`cache[(args, kwargs)] = func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`return cache[(args, kwargs)]`  \n`return wrapper`  \n\n# Using memoize()\n\n`@memoize`  \n`def slow_function(a, b):`  \n`print('Sleeping...')`  \n`time.sleep(5)`  \n`return a + b`  \n`slow_function(3, 4)`  \n\n- Output: Sleeping...\n- Output: 7 s\n`low_function(3, 4)`  \n- Output: 7 \n\nHere we are memoizing `slow_function()`. `slow_function()` simply returns the sum of its arguments. In order to simulate a slow function, we have it sleep for 5 seconds before returning. If we call `slow_function()` with the arguments 3 and 4, it will sleep for 5 seconds and then return 7. But if we call `slow_function()` with the arguments 3 and 4 again, it will immediately return 7. Because we've stored the answer in the cache, the decorated function doesn't even have to call the original `slow_function()` function.\n\n## When to use decorators\n\nSo when is it appropriate to use a decorator? You should consider using a decorator when you want to add some common bit of code to multiple functions. We could have added timing code in the body of all three of these functions, but that would violate the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself. Adding a decorator is a better choice.\n\n- Add common behavior to multiple functions\n\n`@timer`  \n`def foo():`  \n`# do some computation`  \n`@timer`  \n`def bar():`  \n`# do some other computation`  \n`@timer`  \n`def baz():`  \n`# do something else`  ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dc2ab257-6ccd-4d27-a02c-318b1245b4a3"},{"source":"# Print the return type\n\nYou are debugging a package that you've been working on with your friends.

When we try to print the docstring, we get nothing back. Even stranger, when we try to look up the function's name, Python tells us that `sleep_n_seconds()`'s name is \"wrapper\".\n\n## The timer decorator\n\nTo understand why we have to examine the `timer()` decorator. Remember that when we write decorators, we almost always define a nested function to return. Because the decorator overwrites the `sleep_n_seconds()` function, when you ask for `sleep_n_seconds()`'s docstring or name, you are actually referencing the nested function that was returned by the decorator. In this case, the nested function was called `wrapper()` and it didn't have a docstring.  \n\n`# The timer decorator`\n`def timer(func):`  \n`\"\"\"A decorator that prints how long a function took to run.\"\"\"`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`t_start = time.time()`  \n`result = func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`t_total = time.time() - t_start`  \n`print('{} took {}s'.format(func.__name__, t_total))`  \n`return result`  \n`return wrapper`  \n\n## functools.wraps()\n\nFortunately, Python provides us with an easy way to fix this. The `wraps()` function from the functools module is a decorator that you use when defining a decorator. If you use it to decorate the wrapper function that your decorator returns, it will modify `wrapper()`'s metadata to look like the function you are decorating. Notice that the `wraps()` decorator takes the function you are decorating as an argument. We haven't talked about decorators that take arguments yet, but we will cover that in the next lesson.  \n\n`from functools import wraps`  \n`def timer(func):`  \n`\"\"\"A decorator that prints how long a function took to run.\"\"\"`  \n`@wraps(func)`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`t_start = time.time()`  \n`result = func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`t_total = time.time() - t_start`  \n`print('{} took {}s'.format(func.__name__, t_total))`  \n`return result`  \n`return wrapper`  \n\n## The metadata we want\n\nIf we use this updated version of the `timer()` decorator to decorate `sleep_n_seconds()` and then try to print `sleep_n_seconds()`'s docstring, we get the result we expect.  \n\n`@timer`  \n`def sleep_n_seconds(n=10):`  \n`\"\"\"Pause processing for n seconds.`  \n`Args:`  \n`n (int): The number of seconds to pause for.`  \n`\"\"\"`   \n`time.sleep(n)`  \n`print(sleep_n_seconds.__doc__)`  \n`Pause processing for n seconds.`  \n`Args:`  \n`n (int): The number of seconds to pause for.`  \n\nLikewise, printing the name or any other metadata now gives you the metadata from the function being decorated rather than the metadata of the wrapper() function.  \n\n`@timer`  \n`def sleep_n_seconds(n=10):`  \n`\"\"\"Pause processing for n seconds.`  \n`Args:`  \n`n (int): The number of seconds to pause for.`  \n`\"\"\"`  \n`time.sleep(n)`  \n`print(sleep_n_seconds.__name__)`  \n- Output: sleep_n_seconds\n`print(sleep_n_seconds.__defaults__)`  \n- Output: (10,)\n\n\n###  Access to the original function\n\nAs an added bonus, using `wraps()` when creating your decorator also gives you easy access to the original undecorated function via the __wrapped__ attribute.

To do that, we need another level of function nesting. Let's consider this silly run_three_times() decorator.  \n\n`def run_three_times(func):`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`for i in range(3):`  \n`func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`return wrapper`  \n`@run_three_times`  \n`def print_sum(a, b):`  \n`print(a + b)`  \n`print_sum(3, 5)`  \n\nIf you use it to decorate a function, it will run that function three times. If we use it to decorate the print_sum() function and then run print_sum(3,5), it will print 8 three times.  \n\nLet's think about what we would need to change if we wanted to write a run_n_times() decorator. We want to pass \"n\" as an argument, instead of hard-coding it in the decorator. If we had some way to pass n into the decorator, we could decorate print_sum() so that it gets run three times and decorate print_hello() to run five times.  \n\n`def run_n_times(func):`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`   \n`# How do we pass \"n\" into this function?`  \n`for i in range(???):`  \n`func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`return wrapper`  \n`@run_n_times(3)`  \n`def print_sum(a, b):`  \n`print(a + b)`  \n`@run_n_times(5)`  \n`def print_hello():`  \n`print('Hello!')`  \n\nBut a decorator is only supposed to take one argument - the function it is decorating. Also, when you use decorator syntax, you're not supposed to use the parentheses. So what gives?  \n\nTo make run_n_times() work, we have to turn it into a function that returns a decorator, rather than a function that is a decorator. So let's start by redefining run_n_times() so that it takes n as an argument, instead of func. Then, inside of run_n_times(), we'll define a new decorator function. This function takes \"func\" as an argument because it is the function that will be acting as our decorator. We start our new decorator with a nested wrapper() function, as usual. Now, since we are still inside the run_n_times() function, we have access to the n parameter that was passed to run_n_times(). We can use that to control how many times we repeat the loop that calls our decorated function. As usual for any decorator, we return the new wrapper() function. And, if run_n_times() returns the decorator() function we just defined, then we can use that return value as a decorator. Notice how when we decorate print_sum() with run_n_times(), we use parentheses after @run_n_times. This indicates that we are actually calling run_n_times() and decorating print_sum() with the result of that function call. Since the return value from run_n_times() is a decorator function, we can use it to decorate print_sum().\n\n`def run_n_times(n):`\n`\"\"\"Define and return a decorator\"\"\"`\n`def decorator(func):`\n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`\n`for i in range(n):`\n`func(*args, **kwargs)`\n`return wrapper`\n`return decorator`\n`@run_n_times(3)`\n`def print_sum(a, b):`\n`print(a + b)`\n\n## Expanded code\n\nThis is a little bit confusing, so let me show you how this works without using decorator syntax. Like before, we have a function, run_n_times() that returns a decorator function when you call it. If we call run_n_times() with the argument 3, it will return a decorator. In fact, it returns the decorator that we defined at the beginning of this lesson, run_three_times(). We could decorate print_sum() with this new decorator using decorator syntax. Python makes it convenient to do both of those in a single step though. When we use decorator syntax, the thing that comes after the @ symbol must be a reference to a decorator function. We can use the name of a specific decorator, or we can call a function that returns a decorator.  \n\n`def run_n_times(n):`  \n`\"\"\"Define and return a decorator\"\"\"`  \n`def decorator(func):`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`for i in range(n):`  \n`func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`return wrapper`  \n`return decorator`  \n`run_three_times = run_n_times(3)`  \n`@run_three_times`  \n`def print_sum(a, b):`  \n`print(a + b)`  \n`@run_n_times(3)`  \n`def print_sum(a, b):`  \n`print(a + b)`  ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b4b52daf-87f9-4833-ab3c-e1bcd45a4c17"},{"source":"# Run_n_times()\nIn the video exercise, I showed you an example of a decorator that takes an argument: run_n_times().

For our first example, let's imagine that we have some functions that occasionally either run for longer than we want them to or just hang and never return. \n\n`def function1():\n# This function sometimes\n# runs for a loooong time\n...\ndef function2():\n# This function sometimes\n# hangs and doesn't return\n...`  \n\n`@timeout\ndef function1():\n# This function sometimes\n# runs for a loooong time\n...\n@timeout\ndef function2():\n# This function sometimes\n# hangs and doesn't return\n...`\n\nIt would be nice if we could add some kind of `timeout()` decorator to those functions that will raise an error if the function runs for longer than expected.  \n## Timeout - background info\n\nTo create the `timeout()` decorator, we are going to use some functions from Python's signal module. These functions have nothing to do with decorators, but understanding them will help you understand the `timeout()` decorator I am about to show you. \n\n`import signal`  \n`def raise_timeout(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`raise TimeoutError()`  \n`# When an \"alarm\" signal goes off, call raise_timeout()`  \n`signal.signal(signalnum=signal.SIGALRM, handler=raise_timeout)`  \n`# Set off an alarm in 5 seconds`  \n`signal.alarm(5)`  \n`# Cancel the alarm`  \n`signal.alarm(0)`  \n\nThe `raise_timeout()` function simply raises a TimeoutError when it is called. The `signal()` function tells Python, \"When you see the signal whose number is signalnum, call the handler function.\" In this case, we tell Python to call raise_timeout() whenever it sees the alarm signal. The `alarm()` function lets us set an alarm for some number of seconds in the future. Passing 0 to the alarm() function cancels the alarm.  \n\nWe'll start by creating a decorator that times out in exactly 5 seconds, and then build from there to create a decorator that takes the timeout length as an argument. Our `timeout_in_5s()` decorator starts off by defining a `wrapper()` function to return as the new decorated function. Returning this function is what makes `timeout_in_5s()` a decorator. \n\n\n`def timeout_in_5s(func):\n@wraps(func)\ndef wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n# Set an alarm for 5 seconds\nsignal.alarm(5)\ntry:\n# Call the decorated func\nreturn func(*args, **kwargs)\nfinally:\n# Cancel alarm\nsignal.alarm(0)\nreturn wrapper\n@timeout_in_5s\ndef foo():\ntime.sleep(10)\nprint('foo!')\nfoo()\nTimeoutError`  \n\nFirst `wrapper()` sets an alarm for 5 seconds in the future. Then it calls the function being decorated. It wraps that call in a try block so that in a finally block we can cancel the alarm. This ensures that the alarm either rings or gets canceled. Remember, when the alarm rings, Python calls the `raise_timeout()` function. Let's use `timeout_in_5s()` to decorate a function that will definitely timeout. `foo()` sleeps for 10 seconds and then prints \"foo!\". If we call `foo()`, the 5-second alarm will ring before it finishes sleeping, and Python will raise a TimeoutErrror.  \n\nNow let's create a more useful version of the timeout() decorator. This decorator takes an argument. To decorate foo() we'll set the timeout to 5 seconds like we did previously. But when decorating bar(), we can set the timeout to 20 seconds. This allows us to set a timeout that is appropriate for each function. timeout() is a function that returns a decorator. I like to think of it as a decorator factory. When you call timeout(), it cranks out a brand new decorator that times out in 5 seconds, or 20 seconds, or whatever value we pass as n_seconds. The first thing we need to do is define this new decorator that it will return. That decorator begins, like all of our decorators, by defining a wrapper() function to return. Now because n_seconds is available to the wrapper() function we can set an alarm for n_seconds in the future. The rest of the wrapper() function looks exactly like the wrapper() function from the timeout_in_5s() function. Notice that wrapper() returns the result of calling func(), decorator() returns wrapper, and timeout() returns decorator. So when we call foo(), which has a 5-second timeout, it will timeout like before. But bar(), which has a 20-second timeout, prints its message in 10 seconds, so the alarm gets canceled.  \n\n`def timeout(n_seconds):`  \n`def decorator(func):`  \n`@wraps(func)`  \n`def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):`  \n`# Set an alarm for n seconds`  \n`signal.alarm(n_seconds)`  \n`try:`  \n`# Call the decorated func`  \n`return func(*args, **kwargs)`  \n`finally:`  \n`# Cancel alarm`  \n`signal.alarm(0)`  \n`return wrapper`  \n`return decorator`  \n`@timeout(5)`  \n`def foo():`  \n`time.sleep(10)`  \n`print('foo!')`  \n`@timeout(20)`  \n`def bar():`  \n`time.sleep(10)`  \n`print('bar!')`  \n`foo()`  \n- OutputTimeoutError \n`bar()`  \n- Output: bar!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ae6b1fd4-88d1-4bda-a0d4-096afdf8c0a3"},{"source":"## Tag your functions\nTagging something means that you have given that thing one or more strings that act as labels.
