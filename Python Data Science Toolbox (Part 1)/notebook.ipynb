The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function.\n\nRecall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:  \n\nnums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  \n\nresult = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)  \nYou can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.  \n## **Instructions**\n\n- In the map() call, pass a lambda function that concatenates the string '!!!' to a string item; also pass the list of strings, spells.

You will practice this again in this exercise by using a lambda function with filter(), which may be new to you! The function filter() offers a way to filter out elements from a list that don't satisfy certain criteria.\n\nYour goal in this exercise is to use filter() to create, from an input list of strings, a new list that contains only strings that have more than 6 characters.\n\n## **Instructions**\n\n- In the filter() call, pass a lambda function and the list of strings, fellowship.

Here's one more function to add to your repertoire of skills. The reduce() function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike map() and filter(), returns a single value as a result. To use reduce(), you must import it from the functools module.\n\nRemember gibberish() from a few exercises back?  \n\n# Define gibberish  \ndef gibberish(*args):  \n    \"\"\"Concatenate strings in *args together.\"\"\"  \n    hodgepodge = ''  \n    for word in args:  \n        hodgepodge += word  \n    return hodgepodge  \n    \ngibberish() simply takes a list of strings as an argument and returns, as a single-value result, the concatenation of all of these strings. In this exercise, you will replicate this functionality by using reduce() and a lambda function that concatenates strings together.\n\n## **Instructions**\n\n- Import the reduce function from the functools module.\n- In the reduce() call, pass a lambda function that takes two string arguments item1 and item2 and concatenates them; also pass the list of strings, stark.

One way of doing this is through exception handling with the try-except block.\n\nIn this exercise, you will define a function as well as use a try-except block for handling cases when incorrect input arguments are passed to the function.\n\nRecall the shout_echo() function you defined in previous exercises; parts of the function definition are provided in the sample code.

But don't fret! In this exercise, you will improve on your previous work with the count_entries() function in the last chapter by adding a try-except block to it. This will allow your function to provide a helpful message when the user calls your count_entries() function but provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.\n\nOnce again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.\n\n## **Instructions**\n\n- Add a try block so that when the function is called with the correct arguments, it processes the DataFrame and returns a dictionary of results.\n- Add an except block so that when the function is called incorrectly, it displays the following error message: 'The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.'.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"577fd7b7-0dc9-4c1c-8d52-2f42ea2beaab"},{"source":"# Define count_entries()\ndef count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with counts of\n    occurrences as value for each key.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count\n    cols_count = {}\n\n    # Add try block\n    try:\n        # Extract column from DataFrame: col\n        col = df[col_name]\n        \n        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame\n        for entry in col:\n    \n            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1\n            if entry in cols_count.keys():\n                cols_count[entry] += 1\n            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1\n            else:\n                cols_count[entry] = 1\n    \n        # Return the cols_count dictionary\n        return cols_count\n\n    # Add except block\n    except:\n        print('The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.')\n\n# Call count_entries(): result1\nresult1 = count_entries(tweets, 'lang')\n\n# Print result1\nprint(result1)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":13,"lastExecutedAt":1689078763925,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Define count_entries()\ndef count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):\n    \"\"\"Return a dictionary with counts of\n    occurrences as value for each key.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count\n    cols_count = {}\n\n    # Add try block\n    try:\n        # Extract column from DataFrame: col\n        col = df[col_name]\n        \n        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame\n        for entry in col:\n    \n            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1\n            if entry in cols_count.keys():\n                cols_count[entry] += 1\n            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1\n            else:\n                cols_count[entry] = 1\n    \n        # Return the cols_count dictionary\n        return cols_count\n\n    # Add except block\n    except:\n        print('The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.')\n\n# Call count_entries(): result1\nresult1 = count_entries(tweets, 'lang')\n\n# Print result1\nprint(result1)","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":37,"type":"stream"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"48a49550-e511-4108-9ea8-cced6d9bbc59","execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"{'en': 97, 'et': 1, 'und': 2}\n"}]},{"source":"# **Bringing it all together (3)**  \n\nIn the previous exercise, you built on your function count_entries() to add a try-except block. This was so that users would get helpful messages when calling your count_entries() function and providing a column name that isn't in the DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll instead raise a ValueError in the case that the user provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.\n\nOnce again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df.
